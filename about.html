        <p>
            The webpage was made by a novice web designer, currently learning the ropes so that he can develop better web pages
            in the future. This website in particular was made at the request of the 2021 Spring instructor of the CS 355 class at Queens College.
            The goal is to learn and demonstrate what was tought through the creation of websites and web pages such as this one that you are
            currently viewing on your device.
